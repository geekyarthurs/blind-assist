# Blind Assist

This is for the AI Expo 2019.

*Project Description*

In this Project, We will make two things.

1) Gesture Controlled Arm
2) Gesture and Object Detecting Android / Ios App.

*The prototype or resources we are going to use is not disclosed publicly.*

*Team Members Needed*

But, we are lacking in the team of needed enthusiastic embedded systems and android development team members. It's not like employee-employer roleplay, we just need more developer friends ( preferably learners just as us not professionals). If you are interested in joining and achieving a better position in this AI Expo, feel free to contact me at *mahregmi@icloud.com*
